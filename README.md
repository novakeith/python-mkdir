# python-mkdir
create directories in Mac as long as dir doesnt already exist

make new directories based on delimiter in line 6. This is good if you download a bunch of albums, for example, that are in "Artist - Album" format and you want to make new "Artist" folders automatically. It will skip if there is an existing "Artist" folder.
